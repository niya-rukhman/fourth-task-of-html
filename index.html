                        For other uses, see Car (disambiguation) and Automobile (disambiguation).A car (or automobile) is
                        a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of car say they run primarily on
                        roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.[2][3]
                        Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year
                        1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his
                        Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first
                        cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor
                        Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts,
                        but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world. Cars have controls
                        for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and safety, and controlling a variety of lights. Over the
                        decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively
                        more complex. These include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car
                        entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled
                        by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the
                        car, began to become commercially available in 2008. There are costs and benefits to car use. The
                        costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance,
                        fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[4] The costs to society include
                        maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing
                        of the vehicle at the end of its life. Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related
                        deaths worldwide.[5] The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[6]
                        The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive
                        industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and
                        revenue generation from the taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching
                        implications for the nature of societies.[7] There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. The
                        numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries.[8]</p>
